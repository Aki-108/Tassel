# Tassel
A Pillowfort Extension Manager

## What is Tassel?
Tassel provides you with a list of extensions to choose from. You can activate and deactivate them anytime and use as many or as few as you want.
In the Tassel modal you have all settings from different extensions conveniently in one place with explanations of what they actually mean.

## How do you install Tassel?
Simply open GreasyFork and click "Install this script". If you don't already have a script-manager installed, GreasyFork will provide you with instructions on how to get one.

## How does Tassel work?
Tassel only loads the extensions you activate. Extensions that are not active do not use any memory or network bandwidth.
Your settings are stored locally. That means that they are not shared between your devices or even between browsers on the same device.
Settings of an extension remain even after deactivating said extension. If you decide to activate an extension again, your old settings will already be there.
